# Ok, What are Contours and How are they different from edges?

# Edges are computed as points that are extrema of the image gradient in
# the direction of the gradient
#
# Contours are often obtained from edges, but they are aimed at being object contours.
# Thus, they need to be closed curves. We can think of them as
# boundaries. When they are obtained from edges, you need to connect the
# edges in order to obtain a closed contour.

# FINDING CONTOURS

# cv.findContours() finds contours in a binary image
contours, hierarchies = cv.findContours(canny, cv.RETR_TREE, cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
# OK. Lots of new terms used. Let's explain the use of each one of them.

# Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous
# points (along the boundary), having same color or intensity.
# That's why they're used for object detection and are obtained from edges
# cv.findContours returns 2 things :
#                                   1. Contours : Detected contours. Each contour is stored as a
#                                                 vector of points (a list)
#                                   2. Hierarchy: Hierarchy shows how different contours are
#                                                 linked to each other (if some contour is within
#                                                 some other contour or if it contains other contours)
#                                                 It has as many elements as the number of
#                                                 contours. It's an optional output vector
#
# It accepts the following parameters :
#                                   1. image    : Source image of which you'll find the contours.
#                                                 You can use compare, inRange, threshold ,
#                                                 adaptiveThreshold, Canny, and others to create
#                                                 a binary image out of a grayscale or color one.
#                                   2. Mode     : How the contours are obtained. 3 main types
#
# |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
# | cv.RETR_EXTERNAL       | retrieves only the extreme outer contours.             |
# |________________________|________________________________________________________|
# | cv.RETR_LIST           | retrieves all of the contours without establishing any |
# |                        | hierarchical relationships.                            |
# |________________________|________________________________________________________|
# | cv.RETR_TREE           | retrieves all of the contours and reconstructs a full  |
# |                        | hierarchy of nested contours.                          |
# |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
#
#                                  3. Method    : Contour approximation method. 2 main types
#
# |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
# | cv.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE   | stores absolutely all the contour points.              |
# |_______________________ |________________________________________________________|
# | cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE | compresses horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments |
# |                        | and leaves only their end points. For example, an      |
# |                        | up-right rectangular contour is encoded with 4 points. |

# Did you notice how wildly the images differed when we changed the threshold value?
# So, how can we know if the selected threshold value is ideal or not?
# Answer is, trial and error method. But consider a bimodal image
# (In simple words, bimodal image is an image whose histogram has two peaks).
# For that image, we can approximately take a value in the middle of those peaks as threshold
# value, right ? That is what Otsu binarization does.
# So in simple words, it automatically calculates a threshold value from image histogram
# for a bimodal image. (For images which are not bimodal, binarization wonâ€™t be accurate.)
# For threshold value, simply pass zero.
# Then the algorithm finds the optimal threshold value and returns you as the second output, retVal.
# If Otsu thresholding is not used, retVal is same as the threshold value you used.
